Matlab code for SIFT and SURF keypoints extraction and descriptror matching.

find_matches - function, that find matches based on key_points distance |x-x'|<2 && |y-y'|<2  
fixed_treshold - function, that find matches between two descriptors, based on fixed threshold distance  
point_rotation - function, that take vector of points and rotate them in umage space
